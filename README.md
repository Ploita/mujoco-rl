# Mujoco RL

Mujoco RL is a project that implements Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for training agents to solve Mujoco's Inverted Pendulum environment. It includes the implementation of two RL algorithms: REINFORCE and Deep Q-Network (DQN).

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a practical demonstration of RL algorithms applied to the Inverted Pendulum environment. The implemented algorithms are REINFORCE and DQN. REINFORCE is a policy gradient method that directly optimizes the policy, while DQN is a value-based method that uses a deep neural network to approximate the action-value function.

## Installation

To use the Mujoco RL project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mujoco-rl.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install Mujoco and configure the Mujoco environment. Refer to the official Mujoco documentation for installation instructions: [Mujoco Documentation](https://www.mujoco.org/)

4. Run the main script to train the agents:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `agent.py`: Contains the implementations of the REINFORCE and DQN agents.
- `network.py`: Defines the neural network models used by the agents.
- `main.py`: The main script for training the agents and evaluating their performance.
- `environment.py`: Contains environment-specific code and wrappers.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used throughout the project.

## Usage

To train the agents using different algorithms, modify the `main.py` script. Adjust the hyperparameters and experiment settings according to your requirements.

The main steps for training an agent are as follows:

1. Create the environment using the `gym.make()` function.

2. Instantiate the agent of your choice (REINFORCE or DQN) with the appropriate parameters.

3. Train the agent using the training loop, which involves selecting actions, interacting with the environment, and updating the agent's policy or Q-network.

4. Evaluate the agent's performance by running episodes using the learned policy or Q-network.

## Results

The training progress and learning curves can be visualized using the `utils.py` script. This script provides functions to plot the rewards or other performance metrics over episodes or training steps.

Sample learning curves and results can be found in the `results` directory.
